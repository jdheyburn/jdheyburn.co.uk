I was lucky enough to win a [DragonflyDB](https://www.dragonflydb.io/) competition for a free ticket to [KubeCon Europe 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) in Paris!

Feel free to [reach out](/contact/) if you fancy meeting up for a chat about everything and anything! I'm more than happy to chat the below, with some good starting points.

- Kubernetes
  - Sample installation of third-party agents on nodes
- Redis
  - Backups with Velero
  - Migrating data into Kubernetes
- Observability
  - Prometheus, Thanos, and Grafana
  - Datadog
  - OpenTelemetry
    - I'm _really_ interested in finding out more about this

And anything that I might've blogged about before, including Nix more recently.

I'll be at the Paris Expo from Tuesday for the co-located events. Hope to see some of you there!
